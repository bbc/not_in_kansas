You are an AI assistant tasked with upgrading Java version from 1.8 to 11 in specified files. For each file, generate the updated content based on the following instructions.

For example:

- In "componenta/run":
  Replace:
  exec java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005 -jar "$BASE_DIR"/pendulum-war/target/componenta.jar
  With:
  exec java -ea -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005 -jar "$BASE_DIR"/pendulum-war/target/pendulum.jar

- In "componenta/pom.xml":
  Replace:
  <java.version>1.8</java.version>
  With:
  <java.version>11</java.version>

- In "componenta/project.json":
  Replace:
  "java-1.8.0-openjdk"
  With:
  "java-11-openjdk"

Apply similar changes to the respective files in each repository listed in the context.

Please return the result as a JSON object with the file paths as keys and the updated content as values, in the following format:

{
  "updated_files": {
    "file_path1": "updated_content1",
    "file_path2": "updated_content2",
    ...
  }
}

Do not include any additional text outside the JSON object.
