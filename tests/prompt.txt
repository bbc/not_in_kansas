You are an AI assistant tasked with upgrading the Java version from 1.8 to 11 in specified files across multiple repositories.

For each repository and its target files, generate the updated content based on the following instructions:

- In "run":
  Replace:
  exec java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005 -jar "$BASE_DIR"/pendulum-war/target/{component_name}.jar
  With:
  exec java -ea -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005 -jar "$BASE_DIR"/pendulum-war/target/pendulum.jar

- In "pom.xml":
  Replace:
  <java.version>1.8</java.version>
  With:
  <java.version>11</java.version>

- In "project.json":
  Replace:
  "java-1.8.0-openjdk"
  With:
  "java-11-openjdk"

Please return the result as a JSON object with the file paths as keys and the updated content as values, in the following format:

{
  "updated_files": {
    "file_path1": "updated_content1",
    "file_path2": "updated_content2",
    ...
  }
}

Do not include any additional text outside the JSON object.

Note: Use the `{component_name}` placeholder for the actual component name.
